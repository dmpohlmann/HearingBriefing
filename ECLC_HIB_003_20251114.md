## Part A: Executive briefing

### Hearing significance

- This was the first – and, before the March 2026 reporting deadline, the only full-day – public hearing of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's inquiry into the Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 and six related bills
- Seven distinct witness blocs gave evidence across approximately eight hours, covering the full spectrum of affected interests: the Samuel Review author, conservation NGOs, clean energy, biodiversity and legal experts, a philanthropic foundation, mining industry peaks, property developers, and DCCEEW officials alongside the Threatened Species Scientific Committee chair
- The hearing exposed fundamental unresolved disputes – on the legal effect of the RFA exemption, the breadth of the national interest exemption, and whether the bills can demonstrate species-level protection outcomes – that DCCEEW must address before the committee reports
- Prof. Graeme Samuel AC placed on the public record that he does not support the bills in their current form, despite the government framing them as implementing his 2020 review
- The Greens, crossbench, and Coalition each identified distinct lines of attack that, taken together, mean the bills cannot pass the Senate without amendment
- DCCEEW officials were unable to name a single animal species that would receive additional protection under the bills – the most publicly visible exposure of the hearing
- The committee will report by 24 March 2026; the government's stated intention to pass the bills by year-end is now under significant pressure

### Priority flags

The following items require SES attention, ranked by urgency.

**Urgent action**

- Senator Henderson placed two high-risk questions on notice: (a) copies of all departmental advices to the minister on unacceptable impacts criteria; and (b) a summary of proposed amendments drafted by the department not yet made public – responses require Secretary-level clearance and careful legal review before submission (Hansard pp. 71–72)
- DCCEEW officials were unable to provide assessment pathway usage data when asked – this was taken on notice and should be provided promptly (Hansard p. 75)

**Significant risks or exposures**

- The 'what animal will you stop from going extinct' exchange (Senator Hanson-Young to DCCEEW officials, Hansard pp. 80–81) is now on the public record as a clean attack line – an evidence-based species outcomes response must be prepared before any further hearing appearance
- An unresolved legal dispute exists between Samuel's position (that NES would govern RFA-covered activities) and the NGO/EJA position (that sections 38 and 42 as drafted preclude this) – urgent legal advice is required
- CME WA confirmed publicly that it had not met the minister since the bills were tabled, despite MCA having engaged the minister and PM's office – this engagement asymmetry creates a negative record

**Legislative or policy signals**

- Samuel does not support the national interest exemption in its current form – described it as creating 'abuse of power' risk and 'a conga line of lobbyists' (Hansard p. 7 approx.)
- EJA stated that identified legal issues can be resolved by 'simple drafting amendments', directly undermining the government's framing that addressing NGO concerns would require reopening the legislative package
- The mining sector's central objection – subjective unacceptable impacts criteria ('37 definitions across 8 pages') – requires a clause-level response
- Prof. Iain Gordon (TSSC Chair) confirmed the government has not asked TSSC to assess species-level outcomes of the bills, and that TSSC was finalising its own submission

**Forward preparations**

- The TSSC submission – due within days of the hearing – will likely become a primary reference point for the committee and requires immediate departmental response on publication
- Prepare a worked example of the national interest exemption operating at the end of the assessment pathway, for use at the next hearing
- Develop a clearer public explanation of the emissions disclosure provision – what disclosed emissions data is used for and by whom
- AMEC's NORMs/nuclear actions definition concern is technically plausible and may represent an unintended consequence fixable by targeted amendment – obtain legal advice

### Political temperature

- The committee is deeply polarised and the government faces difficult legislative arithmetic in the Senate
- Labor senators (Grogan, Ananda-Rajah) are visibly anxious about the bills failing – Senator Grogan stated she does not want to explain to the environment movement why the legislation failed, while refusing to be held hostage by those demanding perfection
- The Greens (Hanson-Young) ran a disciplined, forensic attack on three specific provisions: the RFA exemption, the continuous use exemption, and the absence of a climate trigger – questioning was well-briefed and designed to build an evidentiary record for Greens amendments
- The Coalition (Henderson, McDonald, Duniam) focused on business certainty – unacceptable impacts criteria, EPA accountability, and inadequate consultation – and is actively seeking documentation to build a dissenting report
- Senator Pocock asked the most technically precise questions, particularly on the offset scheme, the RFA exemption, and emissions disclosure scope – his alignment with the conservation position on exemptions but independent focus on offset integrity makes him a pivotal negotiating partner
- The hearing made clear the bills will require amendment to pass – the question is whose amendments, on which provisions, and at what political cost

### Forward look

- The committee will report by 24 March 2026 and the government wants passage before year-end – these two timelines are now in tension
- The critical path runs through three groups simultaneously: the Greens (who need movement on RFA/continuous use exemptions or a climate trigger), the mining sector (who need a cleaner unacceptable impacts definition), and at least a portion of the crossbench
- DCCEEW must prepare for the next hearing with: (a) a defensible species-outcomes brief with TSSC input; (b) QoN responses to Henderson's requests on departmental advices and draft amendments; (c) assessment pathway usage data; (d) a worked example of the national interest exemption in practice; (e) a clear explanation of how emissions disclosure data feeds into decision-making
- The TSSC submission must be treated as a priority intelligence item – it will be the most technically authoritative document the committee receives and will shape committee recommendations on MNES scope and unacceptable impacts

---

## Part B: Section briefings

### Section grouping note

- This hearing is grouped by **witness bloc** in chronological order of appearance
- Eight distinct blocs appeared across the day, each representing a coherent stakeholder interest
- Grouping by witness bloc best serves analytical clarity because the most significant intelligence from this hearing derives from the positioning, credibility, and internal consistency of each stakeholder group
- Cross-cutting thematic analysis is provided in Part A and Part C; provision-level cross-referencing is provided in L2 of each section

### Section 1: Prof. Graeme Samuel AC – Private capacity (Review author)

*Hansard pages: pp. 1–11*
*Witnesses:*
*Prof. Graeme Samuel AC, private capacity (author, 2020 Independent Review of the EPBC Act)*

**L1 – The record**

1. Appeared in private capacity as author of the 2020 Independent Review of the EPBC Act
2. Questioned by Senators Grogan, Hanson-Young, Henderson, Pocock, Walker, and Thorpe
3. Key topics covered:
   - National interest exemption – scope, abuse of power risk, and comparison with current EPBC exemption
   - RFA and continuous use exemptions – Samuel stated he 'hates' the RFA exemption but acknowledged political constraints (state agreements running to 2030)
   - EPA structure and decision-making role – preferred audit, oversight, and compliance role rather than primary decision-making
   - Climate trigger – opposes a climate trigger; prefers emissions disclosure for projects above 100,000 tonnes with referral to the relevant climate policy body
   - Unacceptable impacts criteria and the role of national environmental standards (NES)
   - Scope of ministerial discretion
4. No documents tabled
5. Acknowledged using AI tools to draft guidance on the national interest definition during the consultative process (Hansard p. 5 approx.)
6. Praised Victoria's early cessation of native forest logging as a model
7. Described a 'self-help hierarchy' where NES rules are sufficiently detailed that proponents can determine permissibility without ministerial intervention

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

8. National interest exemption – Samuel does not support the current form; described it as creating an 'abuse of power' risk and a 'conga line of lobbyists'; advocated removal or incorporation into the MNES balancing test; diverges from DCCEEW's public framing that the exemption is appropriately limited and placed at the end of the assessment pathway (Hansard pp. 5–7)
9. RFA exemption – stated he 'hates' it but acknowledged political constraints; advocated robust NES to govern RFA conduct in the absence of removal; his position that NES would apply to RFA-covered activities is disputed by NGO witnesses on legal grounds (sections 38 and 42)
10. EPA structure – prefers audit, oversight, and compliance role only (not primary decision-making); predicted EPA decision role would diminish to 'almost nothing' once states are accredited; broadly consistent with DCCEEW but goes further in scepticism of EPA decision role
11. Climate – opposes a climate trigger; prefers emissions disclosure for projects above 100,000 tonnes; consistent with the bills as drafted
12. NES specificity – emphasised granular national environmental standards as the mechanism for certainty and reduced litigation

**L3 – Political intelligence**

13. Unusual political dynamic: both government (bills implement his review) and critics (who cite specific objections to current text) claimed Samuel as a supporter
14. His statement that he does not support the bills in their current form is the most significant political signal from this session – it is now on the public record and gives the committee a credible basis for recommending amendments without defeating the bills
15. Labor senators (Grogan) worked to establish Samuel supports the '80 per cent' approach and that business stakeholders moved the goalposts after the consultative process
16. Senator Hanson-Young pressed Samuel on whether NES would govern RFA conduct – he maintained they would; NGO witnesses later disputed this on legal grounds
17. Coalition used Samuel's evidence selectively – cited EPA accountability concerns without engaging with his pro-environment positions

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

18. No formal questions on notice placed in this session
19. Samuel's statement that he does not support the bills in current form creates a public record risk – DCCEEW should prepare written responses to each of his specific objections for use in subsequent submissions and minister briefings
20. The legal dispute over whether NES applies to RFA-covered activities (Samuel says yes; NGOs say sections 38 and 42 preclude it) requires urgent legal advice

**L5 – Forward look**

21. Samuel is likely to be invited to provide a supplementary submission and may reappear at a subsequent hearing
22. His position – supportive of the reform architecture but not current text – is the most likely vehicle for a bipartisan recommendation on the national interest exemption
23. DCCEEW should monitor for any supplementary submission and prepare responses to each of Samuel's specific objections

### Section 2: Conservation NGO bloc – WWF, Greenpeace, ACF

*Hansard pages: pp. 12–23*
*Witnesses:*
*Nicole Forrester, Chief Regenerative Officer, WWF Australia*
*Eleanor (Elle) Lawless, Senior Nature Campaigner, Greenpeace Australia Pacific*
*David Ritter, CEO, Greenpeace Australia Pacific*
*Kelly O'Shanassy, CEO, Australian Conservation Foundation*
*Brendan Sydes, National Biodiversity Policy Adviser, ACF*

**L1 – The record**

24. WWF Australia, Greenpeace Australia Pacific, and Australian Conservation Foundation appeared jointly
25. Questioned by Senators Hanson-Young, Grogan, Pocock, Henderson, and Ananda-Rajah
26. Key topics covered:
    - Legal effect of sections 38 and 42 on RFA-covered forests
    - Continuous use exemption and Great Barrier Reef catchment land clearing data (500,000 hectares cited for 2019–20 and 2022–23)
    - Absence of a climate trigger
    - National interest exemption scope and eligibility
    - Offset scheme and restoration contribution fund – characterised as 'pay to destroy'
27. O'Shanassy tabled written materials; no other documents formally tabled
28. Ritter used the 'bath metaphor': 'Have you ever tried to have a bath where the bath is 95 per cent complete but the plug is not in?'
29. O'Shanassy: 'This is not there. It's nowhere near there, but it can get there' – signalling conditional NGO support
30. Sydes identified sections 38 and 42 as critical provisions unchanged by the bills, arguing the RFA exemption structure is preserved

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

31. RFA exemption (sections 38 and 42) – NGOs argued NES would not legally govern RFA-covered activities; sections 38 and 42 as drafted preserve the existing EPBC exemption structure; this is a material legal dispute unresolved in DCCEEW's public position
32. Continuous use exemption – NGOs cited 500,000 hectares cleared in the GBR catchment (2019–20 and 2022–23), arguing the exemption enables direct threats to reef water quality at scale; DCCEEW has no public response to this specific data
33. Climate trigger – all three organisations characterised its absence as disqualifying; O'Shanassy: 'Environment law in 2025 that doesn't refer to climate change and climate damage is not fit for purpose'
34. National interest exemption – NGOs argued fossil fuel projects should never be eligible; contrasts with DCCEEW's position that all project types are eligible but subject to full assessment before the exemption applies
35. Offset scheme – characterised the restoration contribution fund as 'pay to destroy'; cited NSW (Ken Henry review) as a failed precedent

**L3 – Political intelligence**

36. Senator Hanson-Young used the session to build a formal evidentiary record for Greens amendments on all three exemptions and the climate trigger; questioning was precise and drew on legal advice briefed to her office in advance
37. Senator Grogan pushed back on NGOs – pressing them to acknowledge positive bill elements; consistent with the government's strategy of positioning the bills as the best achievable outcome
38. NGOs acknowledged positive elements (unacceptable impacts definitions, critical habitat, EPA, penalties) while sustaining core objections – signals conditional support contingent on amendments
39. The joint appearance of three major NGOs presenting coordinated legal and policy arguments signals coalition discipline that will sustain throughout the inquiry

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

40. No formal questions on notice placed in this session
41. Exposure: legal dispute on sections 38 and 42 is unresolved on the public record – if the committee asks DCCEEW to clarify whether NES applies to RFA-covered activities, the department needs a definitive legal position
42. Exposure: 500,000 hectare GBR catchment land clearing data was cited without challenge – DCCEEW should verify this figure and prepare a response

**L5 – Forward look**

43. NGO witnesses are likely to be called again or to provide supplementary submissions
44. The legal dispute on sections 38 and 42 must be resolved before the committee reports
45. The climate trigger is the most politically charged issue: without Greens support, passage is uncertain
46. DCCEEW should prepare a clear explanation of: (a) why a climate trigger was not included; (b) what the emissions disclosure provisions achieve in its place; (c) whether any modification could address Greens' concerns without reopening the climate policy architecture

### Section 3: Clean energy sector – CEC, Smart Energy Council

*Hansard pages: pp. 24–32*
*Witnesses:*
*William Churchill, Chief Policy and Impact Officer, Clean Energy Council [by video link]*
*David McElrea, Chief Advocacy Officer, Smart Energy Council [by video link]*

**L1 – The record**

47. CEC and Smart Energy Council appeared jointly, both by video link
48. Questioned primarily by Senators Grogan and Ananda-Rajah
49. Topics covered: urgency of regulatory reform for the energy transition; offset framework; restoration contribution fund; bioregional planning; strategic assessment pathways
50. No documents tabled; both witnesses reserved the right to provide further clarification following consultation with members

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

51. Standards – both organisations described creation of NES as 'incredibly important'; provides on-the-record industry endorsement consistent with DCCEEW's public position
52. Offset framework – both strongly supported the restoration contribution fund as enabling landscape-scale restoration and allowing proponents to discharge obligations without managing projects directly; directly counters the NGO 'pay to destroy' critique
53. Bioregional planning and bilateral/strategic assessments – supported as reducing duplication for renewable energy projects
54. Urgency framing – witnesses emphasised Australia is 'in a race against time' and that delay pushes the country further from energy security, emissions reduction, and lower power bills

**L3 – Political intelligence**

55. Political dynamics: low signal in this section – evidence was broadly supportive and did not generate contested exchanges
56. Government senators used the session to establish on-the-record support from a major economic sector

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

57. No questions on notice placed; no DCCEEW exposure points identified
58. Note: both witnesses reserved the right to clarify after member consultation – if CEC or SEC subsequently lodges a more qualified supplementary submission, this would represent a shift worth monitoring

**L5 – Forward look**

59. Clean energy sector likely to be an active voice during Senate debate on the bills
60. Support for the restoration contribution fund is the most useful counter-narrative to the NGO 'pay to destroy' critique – consider referencing CEC/SEC evidence in subsequent ministerial materials

---

### Section 4: Biodiversity Council, Environmental Justice Australia, Wilderness Society

*Hansard pages: pp. 33–40*
*Witnesses:*
*James Trezise, CEO, Biodiversity Council*
*Dr Peter Burnett, Councillor, Biodiversity Council*
*Prof. Brendan Wintle, Lead Councillor, Biodiversity Council [by video link]*
*Ellen Maybery, Senior Specialist Lawyer, EJA [by video link]*
*Nicola Silbert, Senior Lawyer, EJA [by video link]*
*Sam Szoke-Burke, Biodiversity Policy and Campaign Manager, Wilderness Society*

**L1 – The record**

61. Biodiversity Council, Environmental Justice Australia, and Wilderness Society appeared jointly
62. Questioned by Senators Hanson-Young, Pocock, Henderson, Grogan, and Ananda-Rajah
63. Key topics covered:
    - Offset scheme and restoration contribution fund – 'like for like' test
    - RFA and continuous use exemptions
    - Unacceptable impacts criteria and the 'minister satisfied' drafting test
    - Coal and gas access to the streamlined assessment pathway
    - Availability of simple drafting amendments to resolve identified issues
64. Wintle provided evidence on the draft offset standard released 24–48 hours before the hearing – insufficient time for meaningful analysis
65. Maybery indicated that simple drafting amendments could resolve many identified issues without years of further reform
66. Maybery identified the phrase 'minister satisfied' appearing 'hundreds of times' throughout the bills, arguing it creates unlimited discretion at every decision point
67. Szoke-Burke and Trezise tabled written materials

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

68. Offset scheme (Wintle) – expressed significant concern about the restoration contribution fund enabling deviation from 'like for like' offsets; drew on NSW experience (most offsets channelled through fund, risk transferred to taxpayers, suitable replacement land rarely found); called for tightening to require 'like for like' under all circumstances
69. 'Minister satisfied' test – EJA identified the phrase appearing throughout the bills, arguing it creates unlimited discretion; this is a drafting critique with legal substance requiring a clause-level response from DCCEEW
70. Coal and gas access – EJA and Wilderness Society argued coal and gas projects can access the streamlined pathway with no barrier; DCCEEW officials confirmed this in the afternoon session but argued the streamlined pathway is not a lower standard, only a more efficient process
71. Drafting amendments – Maybery stated explicitly that identified legal issues can be resolved by 'simple drafting amendments', not years of reform; directly undermines the government's argument that addressing NGO concerns would require reopening the entire package

**L3 – Political intelligence**

72. Senator Pocock's questioning on the offset scheme was the most technically sophisticated of the day – pressed Wintle on the NSW comparison and the risk transfer mechanism; suggests Pocock may pursue an amendment to the offset standard or restoration contribution fund provision
73. Senator Hanson-Young continued building an evidentiary record for Greens amendments
74. The EJA 'simple drafting amendments' argument directly undermines the government's 'five years in the making' framing and gives the committee a rationale for recommending amendments

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

75. No formal questions on notice placed in this session
76. Exposure: the draft offset standard was released 24–48 hours before the hearing; multiple witnesses criticised the timing – DCCEEW needs a clear explanation if the committee asks why
77. Exposure: Wintle's NSW offset scheme evidence is specific and factual – DCCEEW should verify or contest the NSW data before it becomes an unchallenged reference point in the committee report

**L5 – Forward look**

78. The offset scheme is the most technically complex and legally contested provision in the package
79. Wintle's evidence will likely be treated as expert testimony by the committee – prepare a detailed technical response to the 'like for like' argument and the NSW comparison
80. The EJA 'simple drafting amendments' argument, if not rebutted, gives the committee a clear rationale for recommending amendments

---

### Section 5: Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation

*Hansard pages: pp. 41–47*
*Witnesses:*
*Lyndon Schneiders, Executive Director, Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation [by video link]*

**L1 – The record**

81. Lyndon Schneiders appeared by video link
82. Questioned by Senators Grogan, Henderson, and Hanson-Young
83. Key topics covered:
    - Overall architecture of the bills – characterised as a faithful representation of Samuel 2020 building on Hawke 2010
    - Net gain concept and restoration contribution fund
    - Critical habitat provisions
    - Emissions disclosure requirements and their decision-making function
    - EPA independence and the statement of expectations mechanism
84. Schneiders commended DCCEEW's work in assembling the legislative package
85. No documents tabled

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

86. Overall architecture – Schneiders characterised the bills as implementing the key elements of Samuel 2020; identified NES with binding decision-maker requirements, outcomes embedded in legislation, critical habitat, net gain, restoration contribution fund, and national EPA as key strengths
87. Current EPBC Act – characterised as enabling extinction and habitat destruction through unfettered discretion: 'no outcomes, only process'
88. Emissions disclosure – noted the purpose of emissions disclosure (once collected by the Environmental Information Agency) is unclear; called for clarification of how disclosed emissions relate to wider climate policy
89. EPA independence – engaged with Senator Henderson's concerns about EPA CEO accountability; supported the statement of expectations mechanism as an appropriate balance

**L3 – Political intelligence**

90. Political dynamics: low signal in this section – evidence was broadly supportive and did not generate adversarial exchanges
91. Senator Henderson used the session to probe EPA accountability – the most likely vehicle for a Coalition amendment

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

92. No questions on notice placed; no direct DCCEEW exposure points
93. Note: Schneiders' observation that the purpose of emissions disclosure is unclear is internally consistent with DCCEEW officials' afternoon evidence – this is a gap in the public architecture

**L5 – Forward look**

94. The emissions disclosure purpose gap will likely attract a committee question on notice or recommendation
95. DCCEEW should develop a clearer public explanation of what decision-makers are expected to do with emissions disclosure information and how it connects to broader climate policy

---

### Section 6: Mining industry – MCA, CME WA, AMEC

*Hansard pages: pp. 48–62*
*Witnesses:*
*Tania Constable, CEO, Minerals Council of Australia*
*Steven Brown, Principal Adviser, Environmental Policy, MCA*
*Chris McCombe, General Manager, Sustainability, MCA*
*Anita Logiudice, Director, Policy and Advocacy, CME WA*
*Warren Pearce, CEO, Association of Mining and Exploration Companies*
*Sash Pavic, Director, Commonwealth, AMEC*

**L1 – The record**

96. MCA, CME WA, and AMEC appeared across the mining industry session
97. Questioned by Senators Henderson, McDonald, Duniam, Pocock, Grogan, Hanson-Young, and Ananda-Rajah
98. Key topics covered:
    - Unacceptable impacts criteria – described as '37 definitions across 8 pages'
    - Retention of existing EPBC assessment pathways
    - EPA accountability and removability of the CEO
    - Compliance and enforcement proportionality
    - Climate disclosures and decision-making function
    - Net gain operability in WA – Crown land, remote areas, minimal baseline biodiversity data
    - Nuclear actions definition and naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs)
99. Constable confirmed MCA had met the minister and PM's office
100. Logiudice (CME WA) confirmed CME WA had not met the minister since the legislation was tabled – stated 'this is really the first opportunity we've had to discuss policy'
101. Pearce (AMEC): 'I'd like to argue about something else. I'd really like to see our projects move forward and to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation critical minerals opportunity'
102. No documents formally tabled

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

103. Unacceptable impacts criteria – industry characterised the current drafting as unclear, subjective, and largely untested; cited 37 definitions across 8 pages; called for a single clear definition; DCCEEW's position that the criteria provide clarity is directly contested
104. Assessment pathways – industry sought retention of all existing EPBC pathways in addition to new pathways; DCCEEW officials confirmed four post-commencement pathways but did not directly address whether any existing pathway was being removed
105. EPA accountability – industry demanded the CEO be accountable and removable by the minister, or that EPA be limited to compliance/enforcement only; aligns with Coalition questioning
106. Climate disclosures – sought explicit exclusion of emissions disclosures from decision-making; DCCEEW's current position (scopes 1 and 2 only, no decision-making function) partially addresses this but has not been clearly communicated
107. Net gain (WA) – CME WA raised particular challenges in Crown land, remote areas with no baseline biodiversity data, and limited offset markets; a genuine implementation gap not adequately addressed in DCCEEW's public position
108. NORMs definition – AMEC argued the nuclear actions definition would inadvertently capture mineral sands and rare earths, requiring 12-month federal assessments; proposed renaming to 'radiological exposure actions' and aligning with ARPANSA; a specific, targeted drafting amendment

**L3 – Political intelligence**

109. The Coalition (Henderson, McDonald, Duniam) used the mining industry session as its primary vehicle for building a record in support of business certainty amendments; focus on EPA accountability and unacceptable impacts criteria aligns with likely dissenting report themes
110. The engagement asymmetry between MCA (met the minister) and CME WA (not met the minister since tabling) is politically significant – CME WA's public statement creates a negative record that will be cited in inadequate consultation arguments
111. AMEC's appeal to move past the argument and get projects approved signals that at least part of the mining sector may be separable from MCA/CME WA on the intensity of their amendment demands

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

112. No formal questions on notice placed in this session
113. Exposure: CME WA's public statement that it had not met the minister since tabling requires a response – DCCEEW should document the extent of departmental-level engagement with CME WA
114. Exposure: the 37 definitions claim should be verified; if accurate, DCCEEW needs a clear explanation of why multiple definitions are necessary and how they interact
115. Exposure: the NORMs definition concern is specific and technically plausible – if AMEC's legal reading is correct, it represents an unintended consequence fixable by targeted amendment; obtain legal advice

**L5 – Forward look**

116. Mining industry witnesses will be a primary source for Coalition dissenting report content
117. The three most likely vehicles for Coalition amendments are: (a) EPA accountability (CEO removability or limiting EPA to compliance/enforcement); (b) unacceptable impacts criteria (single clear definition); (c) NORMs definition (targeted drafting fix, most amenable to acceptance without reopening the architecture)
118. Consider proactively engaging AMEC on the NORMs issue before the next hearing
119. Net gain/WA operability question may attract a recommendation for additional guidance rather than a legislative amendment

---

### Section 7: Property Council of Australia

*Hansard pages: pp. 63–67*
*Witnesses:*
*Matthew Kandelaars, Group Executive, Policy and Advocacy, Property Council of Australia [by video link]*
*Eleanor Sondergeld, National Policy Manager, Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs, Property Council of Australia [by video link]*

**L1 – The record**

120. Property Council appeared by video link
121. Questioned by Senators McDonald, Hanson-Young, Walker, and Grogan
122. Key topics covered:
     - Support for the August 2025 streamlined approvals for 26,000 homes
     - Urgency of reform – current system described as 'broken' with up to four-year approval wait times
     - Bioregional planning as the key mechanism for housing supply improvements
     - Restoration contribution fund as a positive development for the property sector
     - Draft national environmental standards – consultation with members only just beginning
123. No documents tabled

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

124. Urgency – Kandelaars characterised reform as urgent: current system does not work for the environment, does not provide certainty for business, and does not provide certainty for the community; the 26,000 homes streamlined through assessment demonstrated the need
125. Bioregional planning – identified as the primary mechanism for housing supply improvements; eight pilot sites underway including NSW and South-East Queensland covering urban development; Property Council has had limited engagement to date
126. Restoration contribution fund – supported as enabling smaller-quantum offsets to be pooled for greater environmental outcomes and reducing post-approval delays
127. Draft standards – Sondergeld noted they had only just begun discussing implications with members and could not yet comment substantively; standards are proposed as disallowable instruments

**L3 – Political intelligence**

128. Senator Walker used the session to build a positive record for the reforms in the housing context
129. Senator Hanson-Young pressed on whether the streamlined pathway would actually help housing – Sondergeld acknowledged the reduction in statutory timelines but hung most hopes on bioregional planning
130. The Property Council's evidence is the most useful for the government's housing narrative but is qualified – the real benefit is in bioregional plans and standards, neither of which are in the legislation itself

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

131. No questions on notice placed; no direct DCCEEW exposure points
132. Note: the observation that draft standards are disallowable and cannot be amended (Senate must accept or reject entirely) may attract committee attention

**L5 – Forward look**

133. Property Council engagement on the draft standards will deepen in coming weeks – monitor for any shift in positioning
134. The housing narrative is useful for the government but depends on elements (bioregional plans, standards) that sit outside the legislation – a vulnerability if the committee presses on what the bills themselves deliver for housing

### Section 8: DCCEEW officials and Threatened Species Scientific Committee

*Hansard pages: pp. 68–85*
*Witnesses:*
*Rachel Parry, Deputy Secretary, DCCEEW*
*Shane Gaddes, Head of Division, Environment Law Reform Taskforce, DCCEEW*
*Blaine Wentworth, Acting Branch Head, Policy and Legislation Branch, DCCEEW*
*Declan O'Connor-Cox, Acting Head of Division, Environment Regulation Division, DCCEEW*
*Greg Manning, Head of Division, Environment Policy, Regions and Markets, DCCEEW*
*Anna-Liisa Lahtinen, Acting Branch Head, Reform Strategy, DCCEEW*
*Prof. Iain Gordon, Chair, Threatened Species Scientific Committee*

**L1 – The record**

135. DCCEEW officials appeared for the afternoon session; Prof. Gordon (TSSC Chair) joined slightly late
136. Questioned by Senators Henderson, Hanson-Young, Grogan, Pocock, McDonald, and Duniam
137. Key topics covered:
     - Consultation process – minister met over 100 stakeholders, department met over 160 in the last six months
     - Unacceptable impacts criteria – defended as providing clarity compared to current undefined EPBC test; criteria based on existing impact assessment guidelines and developed with expert input
     - Assessment pathways – four post-commencement pathways confirmed: accredited assessment, streamlined assessment, EIS, and public inquiry
     - National interest exemption – sits at the end of the assessment pathway; full assessment and full conditioning required before exemption applies to any residual element; described as 'substantial improvement' on the current EPBC exemption which exempts the entire process
     - Streamlined pathway – estimated 60 per cent initial uptake; no KPIs or formal uptake targets; limits public consultation compared to existing pathways; coal and gas confirmed to have access
     - Bilateral accreditation – state legislation, policies, and processes must meet NES, prohibit unacceptable impacts, and achieve net gain before accreditation
     - NOPSEMA – accredited since 2015; proven specialist capacity; easier to adjust regime via OPGGS Act regulations than through strategic assessment
     - Emissions disclosure – scopes 1 and 2 only, applying across all pathways; purpose described as information gathering for the Environmental Information Agency; officials could not articulate a decision-making function beyond information collection
     - Species protection outcomes
138. Senator Hanson-Young asked officials directly: 'What animal will you stop from going extinct under this legislation?' – officials were unable to name one (Hansard pp. 80–81)
139. Prof. Gordon confirmed: 2,175 species currently listed; government has not asked TSSC to assess species-level outcomes of the bills; TSSC was finalising its own submission to the inquiry (Hansard p. 80)
140. Senator Henderson placed questions on notice (see L4)
141. Parry delivered an opening statement clarifying the department's submission and addressing testimony heard during the day
142. Assessment pathway usage data requested but could not be provided on the day – taken on notice
143. Bills were provided to targeted stakeholders roughly one week before tabling; no NDAs or confidentiality agreements were used; decision was made by government on advice of the department

**L2 – Legislative and policy signal**

144. National interest exemption – officials' explanation is clearer than previous public communications: full assessment must be completed and full conditioning imposed before the exemption applies to any residual element that cannot meet the standards; this is a 'substantial improvement' on the current EPBC exemption which exempts the entire process from assessment; this explanation should be incorporated into all future ministerial materials (Hansard pp. 72–74)
145. Streamlined pathway – officials estimated 60 per cent initial uptake; no KPIs; acknowledged the pathway limits public consultation compared to existing pathways; coal and gas confirmed to have access with no barrier (Hansard p. 75)
146. Bilateral accreditation – if states cannot meet NES, prohibit unacceptable impacts, and achieve net gain, they will not be accredited and may need to change their processes (Hansard pp. 75–76)
147. Emissions disclosure – scopes 1 and 2 only; officials could not articulate a decision-making function beyond information collection; scope 3 excluded as a 'decision of government' (Hansard p. 78)
148. RFA exemption – Manning confirmed no changes in the bills to remove the RFA exemption; minister's intention to apply standards to RFAs is a separate matter not legislated; Gaddes noted removing the exemption is 'not a simple matter' given the industries have not been regulated under the act for some time (Hansard pp. 78–79)
149. Assessment pathways – four post-commencement: accredited, streamlined, EIS, public inquiry; the public environment report pathway is functionally identical to EIS and has been rolled in (Hansard p. 72)

**L3 – Political intelligence**

150. Senator Henderson's QoNs on departmental advices and undisclosed amendments are the most politically significant moment of the officials' session – they signal the Coalition intends to use the discovery process to examine whether internal legal advice contradicts public statements (Hansard pp. 71–72)
151. Senator Hanson-Young's 'what animal' question was a rhetorical trap that officials could not escape – the inability to name a species created a clean attack line that will recur at every subsequent hearing and is already available for environmental media (Hansard pp. 80–81)
152. Government senators (Grogan, Ananda-Rajah) were visibly uncomfortable with some official answers, particularly on the streamlined pathway and coal/gas access – no explicit friction with officials but the political cost of confirming coal/gas access is significant for Greens negotiations
153. Senator Pocock pursued targeted questions on emissions disclosure scope (why not scope 3), RFA exemption removal, and which stakeholders received early access to the bills – his line of questioning signals he will hold the government to the Samuel review recommendations

**L4 – Risk and exposure**

154. QoN 1 – Senator Henderson to DCCEEW: provide copies of all departmental advices to the minister on unacceptable impacts criteria; status: outstanding (Hansard p. 71)
155. QoN 2 – Senator Henderson to DCCEEW: provide a summary of proposed amendments drafted by the department not yet made public; status: outstanding (Hansard p. 72)
156. QoN 3 – Multiple senators to DCCEEW: breakdown of most-used current EPBC assessment pathways and their proportions; status: outstanding – could not be provided on the day (Hansard p. 75)
157. QoN 4 – Senator Pocock to DCCEEW: list of stakeholders who received early access to the bills, exact dates, and the advice in relation to early access; status: outstanding (Hansard pp. 77–78)
158. QoN 5 – Senator Pocock to DCCEEW: policy reasons for not removing the RFA exemption in this legislative package; status: outstanding (Hansard p. 79)
159. Exposure (high): the 'what animal' exchange is the most visible public exposure point from the entire hearing – requires a direct communications response with specific species and protective mechanism analysis, prepared with TSSC input
160. Exposure (medium): officials confirmed no KPIs for streamlined pathway uptake beyond the initial 60 per cent estimate – if the pathway underperforms, there is no accountability mechanism; the committee may recommend mandatory reporting
161. Exposure (medium): the emissions disclosure purpose gap remains unresolved on the public record after three separate witness blocs raised it
162. Exposure (medium): Parry's refusal to summarise departmental advice, while proper, created visible tension with Senator Henderson – the QoN responses will be closely scrutinised

**L5 – Forward look**

163. QoN responses are the most immediate forward obligation; Henderson QoN 1 (departmental advices) and QoN 2 (draft amendments) require careful legal review – internal advice that contradicts the public position creates significant risk if disclosed without context; brief the Secretary's office before responses are finalised
164. The TSSC submission will be the most consequential external document produced during the inquiry – obtain immediately on publication and prepare a detailed technical response
165. The government's inability to name species creates an evidentiary gap the TSSC submission will fill – its conclusions will shape committee recommendations on MNES scope and unacceptable impacts
166. Before the next hearing DCCEEW should prepare:
     - A worked example of the national interest exemption operating at the end of the assessment pathway
     - A clear explanation of what emissions disclosure data is used for and by whom
     - QoN responses to all five outstanding items
     - A species-outcomes brief with TSSC input
     - An assessment pathway usage data table (since 1 July 2022 at minimum, per Senator Henderson's request)

| Warren Pearce, CEO, AMEC | 'Senator, I'd like to argue about something else. I'd really like to see our projects move forward and to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation critical minerals opportunity.' | Part of mining sector prioritises speed over amendment demands – potentially separable from MCA/CME WA | p. 57 approx. |
| Senator Grogan (ALP) | 'I don't know how you or various people are going to feel if this doesn't happen, but I know how I'm going to feel.' (on risk of legislative failure) | Government senator publicly signalling anxiety about failure; key context for Labor's negotiating constraints | p. 31 approx. |
| Senator Hanson-Young | 'What animal will you stop from going extinct under this legislation? They can't answer it.' | Live communications vulnerability; will recur in media and at subsequent hearings | p. 81 approx. |
